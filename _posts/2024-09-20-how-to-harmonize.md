# How to harmonize songs

So, I donâ€™t have a ton of formal music theory backgroundâ€”this is just stuff Iâ€™ve picked up over the years. But if youâ€™re just getting into harmonization, I hope this guide can help you out! Iâ€™m definitely not an expert, but Iâ€™ve managed to work through most songs with some basic techniques.

_Tip: Normally, youâ€™d only harmonize certain phrases in a song. But for practice, try doing it for the whole song! It gives you more to work with and helps you get comfortable with the process._

## Learning Harmonization by Listening

If music theory feels confusing or overwhelming, no worries! Hereâ€™s a simple way to learn harmonization just by listening:

* Pick a song that already has harmonization. Focus on the harmony and listen closely to how it works with the melody. Choose something with a single vocal harmony for starters. Try to memorize it, and if you can, write it down. Practice singing along with the main melody to get the feel of it.

  * Tip: Use a browser extension or plugin that loops sections of the song to make practicing easier.

* You can also check out some of my invites! They include blind harmonies that are already isolated, so you wonâ€™t need to figure out the parts on your own. Here are some links to get you started:

  * [2023 invites - #thvopen_23](https://www.smule.com/search?q=%23thvopen_23&type=recording&sort=popular) -- and so on down

Start small! Select just a few linesâ€”maybe the beginning or end of the refrainâ€”so itâ€™s easier to memorize. Listen to the joins from that invite to hear how the harmony blends with the melody.

Now, a quick heads-up: since youâ€™re learning from my recordings, you might
catch some of my mistakes ðŸ˜…. But donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ve removed the really
bad ones. Modern musicâ€™s chord systems can be pretty complex, and most little
"errors" are no big deal and can be explained away. With a bit of confidence
(+1, +2, +4, +5, +6, +7...), youâ€™ll make it work just fine! ðŸ˜„

Also, I tend to harmonize most of the song for practice purposes, but in regular singing, youâ€™ll typically do much less. You can choose only a subset to harmonize if you prefer!

## Learning By Music Theory

Disclaimer: No matter how much theory you know, ear training is key! If you canâ€™t listen and hear things correctly, all the theory in the world wonâ€™t help ðŸ˜….

### Quick Review of Basic Theory and Notation

Okay, hereâ€™s my super basic (and probably boring) explanation of music theory. Itâ€™s not purely based on formal theory, but it should get you through the essentials. Just rememberâ€”this is the basics! ðŸ˜ƒ

### Music Key

Most songs stick to a single key. The key is named A, B, C, all the way to G. A lot of Western songs are either in a Major or Minor scale. For Minor scale, youâ€™ll see a little â€˜mâ€™ after the letter, like Am, Bm, Cm, etc. (Major scale donâ€™t have any modifier). Minor scale can also have variationsâ€”Vietnamese songs, for example, often fall into harmonic minor.

### Note and Tone

When youâ€™re singing, even if the key changes, the melody usually sounds the same, just higher or lower. To keep things simple, we use the same notation for the tones, no matter the key. The tone namesâ€”Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Tiâ€”stay the same, but they map to different notes depending on the key.

Hereâ€™s a fun fact: there are 12 notes in a musical octave, but we only sing 7 of them in any given scale. Those 7 tones are what shape the melody in whatever key youâ€™re in.

Just to clarify: when I mention notes, Iâ€™m referring to A, B, C, etc. (the absolute notes). When I say tones, Iâ€™m talking about Do, Re, Mi (or 1, 2, 3).

I became familiar with this system by singing songs using the tone names as lyrics. Itâ€™s also a handy way to practice since you donâ€™t need to memorize the actual lyrics, plus it doubles as a good vocal warmup with those clean vowel sounds.

### Shorthand Notation

This is a quick and easy way to write down notes without using traditional musical staff (which focuses more on notes than tones and isnâ€™t always the most practical).

Instead of using the words Do, Re, Mi, etc., we use numbers: 1 for Do, 2 for Re, and so on. So if you see something like 1-3-5, it means youâ€™re singing Do-Mi-Sol, and 2-4-5 would be Re-Fa-La.

Now, Iâ€™ll admit, this isnâ€™t super precise, so youâ€™ll have to rely on your ear to fill in the gaps ðŸ˜ƒ. For completeness, hereâ€™s how we tweak this notation:

* N+ or N- means the note is sharp (#) or flat (b).
* +N or -N indicates an upper or lower octave (since the numbers 1-7 only describe one octave, but in singing, we usually deal with 2-4 octaves).
* +(â€¦) or -(â€¦) means everything in the parentheses is in a higher or lower octave.

### Chords

Chords are super important because theyâ€™re the backbone of harmonization. When you harmonize, youâ€™re basically adding tones to the main melody **based on the chord thatâ€™s playing**. Think of your voice as just another instrument, blending into the overall harmony. Unless youâ€™re singing solo right next to the melody, youâ€™ll want to stick to the same chords as the other instruments. That said, modern chords can get pretty complicated, so thereâ€™s always room to get creative! ðŸ˜ƒ

If you already play an instrument and understand chords, feel free to skim this part.

A basic chord is made up of 3 tones: the root tones, the 3rd, and the 5th. For example, a chord based on Do (1) would include Do (1), Mi (3), and Sol (5). For a chord on Re (2), youâ€™d have Re (2), Fa (4), and La (6). Keep in mind that a chord on Do could also look like -5-1-3 or -3-5-1, since tones repeat in each octave.

Advanced chords can get a lot more complex and might use anywhere from 2 to 5 tones, or even more!

#### Major Scale Chords

In a major scale, the chords in number notation are: 1, 2m, 3m, 4, 5, and 6m.

These chords are built using only the tones from the major scale. The structure of the scale determines whether a chord is major or minor.

#### Minor Scale Chords

For a minor scale, the number notation would be: 1m, 3, 4m, 5m, 6, and 7.

If you lower the major key by 1 and 1/2 steps, you get the equivalent minor key.

In Western music, we often use the harmonic minor scale instead of the strict minor scale. This means the 7th note is raised, giving you the chord set: 1m, 3, 4m, 5, 6, and 7.

#### Pentatonic Scale

Vietnamese folk music (dÃ¢n ca), influenced by Chinese music, often uses the pentatonic scale. I wonâ€™t dive into the details to avoid adding confusion, but it follows the same basic principles as other scales.

Interestingly, most folk Vietnamese songs donâ€™t typically include harmonization. But feel free to experiment with it (as I often do) for fun! It actually sounds pretty good, so itâ€™s more of a convention than a hard rule.

### Harmonization - Music

This guide only covers a basic, note-by-note harmonization technique. There are many other methods out there, so feel free to explore them!

#### The Basics of Harmonization

When harmonizing, you assume the main melody note is one of the tones in the current chord. Youâ€™ll be singing one of the other tones from that chordâ€”usually a 3rd or 5th above or below the melody.

Hereâ€™s the catch: the specific 1, 3, and 5 tones you choose for harmonizing depend on the chord being played. Thatâ€™s why knowing the chords is crucial before adding harmonies. You can find chords on sites like hopamviet.vn or hopamchuan.com. Just keep in mind that the band youâ€™re singing with might play differently from those sites, so having some good listening skills is essential!

To make things trickier, we sing using 7 notes, but a basic chord only has 3 notes. So how do you harmonize?

#### Some Simple Principles

Decide whether you want to harmonize using the 3rd (higher harmony) or the 5th (lower harmony). Each chord contains three notes, but youâ€™ll only be singing one, so make your choice.

Higher harmonies (3rd) tend to brighten the music and create excitement. Theyâ€™re also easier to learn at the beginning since your voice stands out more.

Lower harmonies (5th) provide depth and richness to the main melody.

Select a harmony that fits within the middle range of your voice. You can either stick with one choice for the entire song or switch it up by phrase, but make sure to maintain consistency throughout the song.

#### High vs. Low Harmonization

* For high harmonization (3rd), if the melody goes 1, 2, 3, 4, you sing 3, 4, 5, 6 (staying in the chord).
* For low harmonization (5th), if the melody goes 1, 2, 3, 4, you sing lower tones like -5, -6, -7, -8.
* Stay close to the main melody when harmonizing. The 3rd is closer (higher harmony), while the 5th is lower (and often sung in the lower octave).

#### Harmonization Tips

* All your harmony tones should ideally match the 3 notes in the current chord. But you can be flexibleâ€”just make sure the first and last notes of a phrase are part of the chord, and let the middle notes follow the flow. I personally go with this relaxed approach most of the time.  _This follows the convention of chording to select chord based on such criteria._

  **Example with the C chord and 3rd (high harmony):**

* Melody: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 3
* Strict harmony: 3, 5, 5, +1, +1, 5
* Relaxed harmony: 3, 4, 5, 7, +1, 5

* Keep your harmony line tight by varation to basic rules. The melody may jump around, but your harmony should move in smaller steps to stay closer together. This makes it easier to sing and keeps the focus on the melody.

It might help to write down your harmony notes, and if you have access to a keyboard, try playing them to get more familiar with how it sounds.

#### Summary

* Harmonize based on the current chord.
* Choose either a high or low harmony and stick with it.
* Stay on tune.  Harmonization is a musical line just like any others.

### Singing Style for Harmonization

Pick spots where your harmony will have the most impact:

* The beginning or end of the refrain
* Emphasize key parts at the song's ending

Sing with a lighter, airier voice and softer volume than the main melody

Stick to either:

* Singing right on the beat (like a backing vocal), or
* Matching the main melody timing exactly (a cappella style)

  The second option can be tricky, especially if youâ€™re doing blind harmonies on Smule.

Keep practicing until it feels natural, and then you can start adding your own flair!
