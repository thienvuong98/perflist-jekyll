### For Playing with Full Band

In full band, you do not want style be played (or heard).  But you still want
all the voices, OTS, and pads to be available and customized for each song.

* Check MusicFinder and load playlist + quick style
* Freeze registration
* Change mixer to bring Style mix to 0% (mute it)
* Change split point to bring to C1 (full keyboard for performance)
* Disable ACMP and enable OTS Link

### For One Man Band

* Check MusicFinder and load playlist + quick style (very important)
* Freeze registration
* Change mixer to bring Style to 100%
* Change split point to bring to F#2 (normal split)
* Enable ACMP and OTS Link
