A new [playlist](/playlist) is created for 2024 since I've lost lots of the assets/data from the old playlists (pre-covid).   It sports a much simpler interface to use on mobile device (phone/tablet)

To get to the new [playlist](/playlist) go [here](/playlist).   Latest list is [2024-04](/playlist/2024-04)

As in previous incarnation, each playlist is created for a practice session and/or performance.  The goal is to get to the information quickly for practice.  It could also be used for performance as well (but probably not optimized for that)

## Main Page

* The list shows columns title, singer, genre.tempo, key.transpose, music preview/parts, note
* Search box on top right is used to type in search for any thing in the playlist.
* Clicking on the title will open https://hopamviet.vn or https://hopamchuan.com page for the song.   We'll use mostly hopamchuan, unless song is not availabe there.  *But see the following notes*.
* Clicking on singer or beat will search for all perf for the singer.  The beat will also show the tempo if specified
* Clicking on key will open up a simple lyric page with chords already transposed to the specified key.  In effect, you don't need to click the song, switch tab, remember which key to transpose, and try transpose it there. *This does require that the source list have the key for singer.  If not the lyric would be shown with the native chords, and you'd better off going to the site directly*.  
* The key also may include a transpose value.  Some difficult base key could be transpose 1/2 or 1 tone lower then use transpose to switch - that will keep the playing simpler.  Actually we should encourage singer to use simpler base key (w/o transposition).  Only top-notch professional singer needs to be at the exact key.  Most others could drop 1/2 tone with any impact.

### Music and Play Loops

Where possible, the youtube video of a performance will be shown here.  Clicking on the headphone icon opens up a mini-player playing the song.  In addition, some segments (intro, mid, ending) are also presented.  Clicking on any of these will just play loops of that particular segments - this is used for practice to memorize the playing style.

### Lyric Page

Lyric page is a much simpler version of lyrics on hopamviet.   No distracting details, larger / bold font, and pre-transposed to the playing key.  Essentially after the song is selected, this page could be used for playing.

* There is a [chord] button also to toggle whether chords / playing note should be shown or not.   Hiding would be useful if it is used by singer to remove all distracting details.
* There is an intro play/stop to loop play the intro section to help remind musicians
* The header of the page also includes additional playing notes for the song for the band  in addition to standard hopamviet info (i.e chords for intro, mid, sound, etc...)

### Issues

* When open hopamviet on a different tab, the tab may not come up in foreground, and you may have to look up the tab and manually switch to.
* Many youtube videos, especially English songs, would block being embedded in the mini-player.  You may click through to play full screen, but loop playing would not work in that case.
