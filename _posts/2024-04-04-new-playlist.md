A new [playlist](/playlist) is created for 2024 since I've lost most of
the assets/data from the old playlists (pre-covid).   It sports a much
simpler interface to use on mobile device (phone/tablet)

As in previous incarnation, each playlist is created for a practice
session and/or performance.  The goal is to get to the information
quickly for practice and performance.

The list is sourced from a public accessible Google Sheet.  So user could
continue updating the sheet to make any needed changes and it will be
picked up later when the list is re-generated.

## Main Page

* The list shows columns title, singer, genre.tempo, key.transpose(lead),
  music preview/parts, note
* Search box on top right is used to type in search for any thing in
  the playlist.
* Clicking on the title will open a tab to the lyric source
  (<https://hopamviet.vn> or <https://hopamchuan.com>) for the song.  *But see
  the following note on key button*.
* Clicking on singer or beat will search for all matching entries.
  The beat also shows the tempo if so specified
* Clicking on key button will open up a simple lyric page with chords already
  transposed to the specified key.  In effect, you don't need to click
  the song, switch tab, remember which key to transpose, and try transpose
  it there. *This requires that the source list have the key for singer.
  Otherwise the lyric would be shown with the original chords.*
* The key also may include a transpose value.  Some difficult base key
  could be transpose 1/2 or 1 tone lower then use transpose to switch -
  that will keep the playing simpler and allow for better solos[^1].

[^1]: Encourage singer to use simpler base key (w/o transposition). Only top-notch professional singers need to be at the exact key.  Most others could drop 1/2 tone without any impact.

### Music and Play Loops

When available, the youtube video[^2a] of a performance will be shown here.
Clicking on the headphone icon opens up a mini-player playing the song.
In addition, some segments (intro, mid, ending) are also presented.
Clicking on any of these plays loops[^2] of that particular segments

[^2]: This is used for practice to memorize the playing style.
[^2a]: Many youtube videos, especially English songs, would block being embedded in the mini-player.  A warning message would be shown in the video frame.  You may click through to play full screen, but loop playing would not work in that case.

### Lyric Page

When you click on the key button, a lyric page will pop up.
It's a local simpler version of lyrics from the lyrics website.  No ads,
distracting details, larger / bold font, and pre-transposed to the
playing key. Essentially after the song is selected, this page could
be used for playing or singing.[^3]

[^3]: We could also add additional notes on the lyrics.  For example, how to sing, intro chords, voice setup, etc ...

* On top of page, there is an intro play/stop to play the song or loop
  the intro to help remind musicians
* The top of page also includes additional playing notes for the song for
  the band (i.e chords for intro, mid, sound, etc...)
* On bottom of page, there is a button also to toggle whether chord
  visibility. Hiding is useful when used by singer to remove distracting
  details.
* Also, forward/backward navigation button is there to walk through the lyrics
  without needing to go back to the main page[^4].

[^4]: Currently broken
