A new [playlist](/playlist) is created for 2024 since I've lost lots of
the assets/data from the old playlists (pre-covid).   It sports a much
simpler interface to use on mobile device (phone/tablet)

To get to the new [playlist](/playlist) go [here](/playlist).

As in previous incarnation, each playlist is created for a practice
session and/or performance.  The goal is to get to the information
quickly for practice.  It could also be used for performance as well
(but probably not optimized for that)

The list is sourced from a public accessible Google Sheet.  So user could
continue updating the sheet to make any needed changes and it will be
picked up later when the list is re-generated.
## Main Page

* The list shows columns title, singer, genre.tempo, key.transpose(lead),
  music preview/parts, note
* Search box on top right is used to type in search for any thing in
  the playlist.
* Clicking on the title will open a tab to the lyric source
  (https://hopamviet.vn or https://hopamchuan.com) for the song.  *But see
  the following notes*.
* Clicking on singer or beat will search for all matching entry.
  The beat also shows the tempo if specified
* Clicking on key button will open up a simple lyric page with chords already
  transposed to the specified key.  In effect, you don't need to click
  the song, switch tab, remember which key to transpose, and try transpose
  it there. *This requires that the source list have the key for singer.
  Otherwise the lyric would be shown with the original chords.*
* The key also may include a transpose value.  Some difficult base key
  could be transpose 1/2 or 1 tone lower then use transpose to switch -
  that will keep the playing simpler.  Actually we should encourage singer
  to use simpler base key (w/o transposition).  Only top-notch professional
  singer needs to be at the exact key.  Most others could drop 1/2 tone
  with any impact.

### Music and Play Loops

When available, the youtube video of a performance will be shown here.
Clicking on the headphone icon opens up a mini-player playing the song.
In addition, some segments (intro, mid, ending) are also presented.
Clicking on any of these will just play loops of that particular segments
- this is used for practice to memorize the playing style.

### Lyric Page

Lyric page pops up when you click on the key button of the song entry.
It is a much simpler version of lyrics on the lyrics website.  No ads,
distracting details, larger / bold font, and pre-transposed to the
playing key.  Essentially after the song is selected, this page could
be used for playing or singing.

* On top of page, there is an intro play/stop to play the song or loop
  the intro to help remind musicians
* The top of page also includes additional playing notes for the song for
  the band (i.e chords for intro, mid, sound, etc...)
* On bottom of page, there is a button also to toggle whether chord
  visibility. Hiding is useful when used by singer to remove distracting
  details.
* Also, forward/backward navigation button is there to walk through the lyrics
  without needing to go back to the main page

### Issues

* When open hopamviet on a different tab, the tab may not come up in foreground, and you may have to look up the tab and manually switch to.
* Many youtube videos, especially English songs, would block being embedded in the mini-player.  You may click through to play full screen, but loop playing would not work in that case.
